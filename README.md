The challenge focuses on models to determine whether a patient admitted to an ICU has been diagnosed with a particular type of diabetes, Diabetes Mellitus. 

Intensive Care Units (ICUs) often lack verified medical histories for incoming patients. A patient in distress or a patient who is brought in confused or unresponsive may not be able to provide information about chronic conditions such as heart disease, injuries, or diabetes. Medical records may take days to transfer, especially for a patient from another medical provider or system.

### Data
- The data are from the first 24 hours of intensive care from MITâ€™s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiative.

### Evaluation
- Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC).
